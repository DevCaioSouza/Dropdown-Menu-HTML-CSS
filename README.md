Hello Guys. This is a dropdown menu that i made using only HTML and CSS,  without the use of any scripts such as jQuery or anything. It's very nice for you to use on websites<br>

Here in this GIF you can see it working<br>



Or you can directly access it through the following link: https://dropdownmenu-html-css.netlify.app <br>
